Analyze the target audience for some Facebook ads.
The data set has the following columns:

1. "ad_id": unique identifier for an advertisement
2. "campaign _id": unique identifier associated with campaign tracking
3. "age"": age of the person to whom the ad is shown
4. "gender": gender of the person to whom the ad is shown
5. "impressions": the number of times the ad was shown
6. "clicks": the number of clicks on the ad
7. "conversions": the number of users who made orders after seeing the ad\
8. "spent": amount paid to the platform to show the ad

Define user combinations by 'age' and 'gender columns that have minimal costs per impression, click, and conversion. Process the data as follows.

> Replace character column "age" with a numeric column that contains the mean value from the string, For example, instead of string value "30-34", assign the numeric value "32", the result of (30 + 34)/2.
> The costs per impression, click, and conversion are calculated as "spent" by the values "clicks", "impressions", and "conversions".
> Calculate costs per impressions, clicks, and conversions by columns "age" and "gender" for each advertisement campaign.
> For each combination of "age" and "gender", columns calculate mean costs per impression, click, and conversion. Round values to 5 digits after the decimal point.
> Determine the combinations of "age" and "gender" with minimal costs per impression, click, and conversion.

The result data set should be a table with 4 columns and 3 rows
Columns should be "metric_name", "metric_ value", "age", and
"gender". Rows should have data about "age" and "gender" by
metric names in the following order: "mean_cost_per_impressions".
"mean_cost_per_clicks", and "mean_cost_per_conversions" metrics.
Keep only metrics with non-zero values.
