Given a loan data set from institutions in different countries, define and evaluate a competitiveness index for each country

The data frame contains five columns:

Year: The year the application was filed.
Country: The country where the bank is located.
Inst_id: Institutional id of the bank that processed the application.
Loan_amount: The loan amount applied for.
Action_type: The loan is approved (1) or rejected (0).

Process the data and calculate the competitive index for each
country for each year. The competitive index is determined with the
following process:
1. Consider only the applications which are approved (Action_ type = 1).
2. Calculate the total loan amount sanctioned by a bank each year in a country: Loan_amt_bank.
3. Calculate the total loan amount sanctioned per year by all the banks for each country: Loan_amt_country.
4. Calculate the squared market-share for each bank:(Loan_amt_bank/Loan_amt_country)^2.
5. Calculate the Competitive_index for each country as the sum of the squared market-shares (calculated in step 4) each year.
6. Sort the data frame by "Year" in ascending order and "Country" in alphabetical order.
7. Round the "Competitive_index" to three digits.
Note: You can use package "dplyr" for data processing.

For example, the data for some mortgage applications is as follows:
"Year", "Country", "Inst_id", "Loan_amount","Action_taken"
2010."AUS"."001".,449000,1 2011,"AUS"."002",807000,1
2010,"AUS"."002",279000,1 2011."CAN","001",200000,0
2010, "AUS"."002".748000,1 2011."CAN"."001",644000,1
2010,"CAN","001",949000,1 2011,"CAN","002",962000.1
2010,"AUS","002",587000,1 2011,"AUS","001",696000,1
2011,"AUS","002",974000,1 2011,"AUS","001",565000,1

The data once processed is,
"Year","Country ","Competitive _index"
2010,"AUS",0.659
2010,"CAN",1
2011,"AUS"0.515
2011,."CAN",0.52

Explanation:
At first, the rejected mortgage application in row 4 is removed
(Instruction: 1).
In 2010, there are four mortgage applications filed in AUS that are
approved by two institutions "001 and "002". The total amount of
sanctioned loan (Loan_amt_bank) by "001" and "002" is 449000 and is
1614000 (total of 279000,748000 and 587000), respectively
(Instruction: 2).
So, the total loan sanctioned (Loan_amt_country) in AUS in the year
2010 is 2063000 (Instruction: 3).
The squared market-share for both the institute will be 0.047 and
0.612 (Instruction: 4).
Therefore, the competitive-index for AUS in 2010 will be 0.659, i.e. the
sum of 0.047 and 0.612 (Instruction: 5).
Similarly, the other "Competitive_index" values are calculated.
Finally, the output data frame is sorted and "Competitive_index" is
rounded to three decimals (Instruction: 6 & 7).
